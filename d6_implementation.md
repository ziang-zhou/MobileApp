# D6 Implementation 2

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, impulse, under-planning
and unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have purchased or want to purchase in the future. This app will allow for the user(s) to enter, update, and delete purchases that they have made, these purchases will help construct a graph of te users purchase history to help with healthier spending habits and promote more financial stability.

## Code Quality
In this iteration of our release we used mostly Java and we all generally followed Java's coding best practices that we have learned from previous NAU courses.

 Describe how your team managed code quality. What were your policies, conventions, adopted best practices, etc. to foster high quality code? 

## Lessons Learned
In Retrospective I think that we as a team are still struggling to work together and really get our application running. We are also still struggling with people that do not necessarily do all of the work they are given consistently. We think that if we were to keep working on this project together we would really have to be stricter about deadlines and not allowing anyone to slack off like we have been.
